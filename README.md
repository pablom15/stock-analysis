# stock-analysis

#Challenge

The PabloChallenge() sub routine creates an analysis of start price, end price, and total volume for each stock ticker located in the yearly data sheets. This refactored code is diffent from the code created during the module because it uses an array to execute the analysis instead of only using For Loops and Nested For Loops. Ultimately, the refactored code is more efficient and easier to follow.
